/*The loginUser controller function is similar to the registerUser controller function. It takes the email or username and password from the request body. The email or username is required to login. If the email or username is not provided, an error is thrown. The user is found in the database using the email or username provided in the request body. If the user is not found, an error is thrown. The isPasswordCorrect method is called on the user object to check if the password provided in the request body is correct. If the password is incorrect, an error is thrown. The generateAccessandRefreshTokens function is called to generate the access and refresh tokens for the user. The user object is retrieved from the database, excluding the password and refresh token fields. The options object is used to set the HTTPOnly and Secure flags for the refresh token cookie. The access and refresh tokens are returned in the response along with the user object. The access token is set as an HTTP-only and secure cookie in the response. The refresh token is set as an HTTP-only and secure cookie in the response. The user is logged in successfully. The logoutUser controller function is used to log out the user. It takes the refresh token from the request cookies. If no refresh token is provided, an error is thrown. The user is found in the database using the refresh token. If the user is not found, an error is thrown. The refresh token is set to null and saved to the database. The access and refresh tokens are cleared from the response cookies. The user is logged out successfully.*/
